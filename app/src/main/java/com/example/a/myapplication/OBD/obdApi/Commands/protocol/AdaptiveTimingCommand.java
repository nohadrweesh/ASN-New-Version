 * when receiving response from a vehicle , the elm372 has traditionally waited the time set by the AT ST hh setting for
 * response. to ensure that the IC would work with a wide variety of vehicles.
 *
 * By default, Adaptive Timing option 1 (AT1) is enabled, and is the recommended setting.
 * AT0 is used to disable Adaptive timing (so the timeout is always as set by AT ST),
 *while AT2 is a more aggressive version of AT1 (the effect is more noticeable for very
 * slow connections â€“ you may not see much difference with faster OBD systems.
